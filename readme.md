> Open Source Chatbot Framework for NodeJS, configurable with JSON.

#### This package is in active development by the team at [Formsend](https://formsend.org). It will form the backbone of an upcoming feature. API will probably change in the future. Pull Requests and Feature Requests are welcomed.

## Install

```sh
npm i formsend/chatbot
``` 
Note: This package is NOT on NPM, yet. When you 'npm i formsend/chatbot' you're downloading it directly from this Github. Heads up. We will add it to NPM in the coming weeks.

## Simple Example

```js

const ChatBot = require('@formsend/chatbot');

;(() => {

	var features = [

		{
			name: "Cookie",
			confirmation: "Do you want a cookie?",
			triggers: [ "cookie" ],
			fields: [
				{
					label: "What flavor?",
					name: "flavor"
				},
			],
			action: async (fields) => {
				return `üç™`
			}
		},

	]

	/**
	* @param context [string] unique id for that context
	* @param message [string] ongoing conversation message
	* @param answers [object] array of possible answers
	* @param configuaration [object] array of possible answers
	*/
	var answer = await ChatBot('uniqueId', 'Cookie', answers, configuaration)

	console.log( answer ) // Do you want a cookie? 

})()

```

## Express Example
```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

const features = [
	{
		name: "Cookie",
		confirmation: "Do you want a cookie?",
		triggers: [ "cookie" ],
		fields: [
			{
				label: "What flavor?",
				name: "flavor"
			},
		],
		action: async (fields) => {
			console.log( fields.flavor )
			return `üç™`
		}
	},
]

app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
	req.query.message = req.query.message || 'Cookie'
	res.send( await ChatBot('contextId', req.query.message, answers) )
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```
