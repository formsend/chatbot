## Install

```sh
npm i formsend/chatbot
``` 

## Express Example
```javascript
const ChatBot = require('@formsend/chatbot')
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

var answers = [
	{
		name: "Cookie",
		confirmation: "Do you want a cookie?",
		triggers: [ "cookie" ],
		fields: [
			{
				label: "What flavor?",
				name: "flavor"
			},
		],
		action: async (fields) => {
			console.log( fields.flavor )
			return `üç™`
		}
	},
]

app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
	if (!req.query.message) return res.send("Message is required.")
	res.send( await ChatBot('contextId', req.query.message, answers) )
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```

### Terminal Chatbot üòé
```javascript
const ChatBot = require('@formsend/chatbot')

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,

var answers = [

var recursiveAsyncReadLine = function () {
  rl.question('> ', async (answer) => {
    if (answer == 'exit') return rl.close()
    if (answer == 'clear') return console.clear()
    console.log( await ChatBot('jenkins', answer, answers) )
